# dotfiles

Restore your Dotfiles automatically:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodelyTV/dotly/HEAD/restorer)
```

You need to know your GitHub username, repository and install ssh key if your
repository is private. It also supports other git repos, but you need to know
your git repository URL.
